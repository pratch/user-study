🎯 Enhanced Face-Aware Video Cropping Solution
Key Improvements:
✅ Smart Face Detection: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces across multiple frames
✅ Intelligent Crop Positioning: Calculates optimal square crop region that includes the entire face
✅ Width Maximization: For portrait videos, uses full video width (560px, 275px, 550px) as crop dimension
✅ Face-Centered Cropping: Positions the crop region to ensure faces are well-centered and fully visible

Face Detection Results:
4DGS method: Faces detected at Y-positions ranging from 118 to 318 (200px variation!)
LAM method: Faces detected at Y-positions ranging from 40 to 151 (111px variation!)
GA method: Faces detected at Y-positions ranging from 127 to 324 (197px variation!)
Processing Results:
108 total videos processed across 6 methods
54 videos with face-aware cropping (portrait videos from 4dgs, lam, ga methods)
54 videos copied as-is (already 512x512 from ar, hr, gaga methods)
0 errors - all processing successful
All outputs are perfect 512x512 with faces properly preserved

Technical Features:
Multi-frame sampling: Analyzes 10 frames per video for robust face detection
Largest face selection: When multiple faces detected, picks the largest one
Averaging for stability: Uses average face position across frames for consistent cropping
Intelligent positioning: Calculates crop region to include face with padding while maximizing area usage
High-quality encoding: Uses CRF 18 with Lanczos scaling for best visual quality
